 December 1: Prof. Graham's comments --> rethink structure of project. Historical theory? History from below and anti-colonial approach, goes hand in hand with counternarrative and giving voices to individuals of history, not lumping entire group of "victims" into a single homogenous blob devoid of their own experiences and stories. Will also help to avoid falling into the traps of presenting these stories in a paternalistic or victimization fashion, as I am a settler. 
- December 3: I also need to rework which stories I want to tell. I think that focusing solely on the experiences of children to have experienced residential schools confines the issues of systemic racism and colonialism to the past. Sewing these stories together with ones from the present, more recent past, and the past preceding residential schools will present the issues as temporally unconfined. One challenge will be the research process going further back in time, as I want to exclusively use case studies to humanize individuals in an effort to contextualize the reality and extent of the cruelty of colonialism in all of its (temporal) forms. 
- December 4: I've also decided that using AI voices for this project would be a very poor choice, and that sticking with my own voice for most of the echoes is the most authentic way for me to conduct this project, rather than trying to distance myself and my identity from the final product. I do, however, think that alternative auditory things would make for a more interesting project and provide agency to Indigenous people. By this, I mean that using songs, poems, or talks by Indigenous people for some of my echoes would bring added depth and authenticity to the project. I think I was mentally limiting myself too much in terms of the possibilities for this project. With an essay, I'd be thinking about how to paraphrase certain excerpt or if I should use block quotes to maximize authenticity, but here, I can use the primary source material in its original and humanizing form within my own project. It just took me a while to open my mind to the scale of possibilities here, but re-reading the Jennifer Evans article really helped me reflect on the amount of space I have to be creative. 
- December 6: While walking by the Centennial Flame on the way back from work, I realized that it's circular shape will be really helpful in telling these stories in a non-linear fashion, but that it also enables me to make rings of echoes around it. I think that having two rings of echoes, one with 5 that focus on Residential school victims (including those of intergenerational trauma) and one that is not limited in its scope by either institution or time would make for a very interesting experience, especially as it would allow me to overlap echoes from different eras to draw links between them and convey to the listener that they are far more similar than they are different from each other. 
- December 8: I played around with the Echoes creator page today to get a sense of how it worked, I know that I put this off for WAY too long, but here we are. Fortunately it's very user friendly and I plopped down some echoes around the centennial flame as a test run, which went well. 
- December 9: I've been doing more research for primary source material and I believe that despite focusing on Canada and centring this project around the Centennial Flame, that strictly adhering to the colonial borders of Canada would be unwise. One of my favourite books on Indigenous self-determintation is by Robin Wall Kimmerer, who has lived her whole life on land that is apart of what is internationally recognized as the United States, but her experiences with colonialism don't much differ from those in Canada, and in the end, this is an anti-colonial project, so I think that using a colonial geographic framework to confine it would be deeply ironic.
